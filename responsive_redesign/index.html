    <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this project, I practiced the workflow of redesigning a simple website. I exercised my skills in analyzing
        and identifying flaws in an existing interface, creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for various
        screen sizes, and building a responsive website based on those prototypes.
    </p>
    <h2>Identifying Usability Problems</h2>
    <h3>Picking a Web Page</h3>

    <p>
        I chose the <a href="https://www.fellinipizzeria.com/">Fellini Pizzeria</a> website because I think there are
        immediately apparent usability problems with the site, which is a shame because their pizza is pretty good. In
        particular, I want to examine how the presentation of information on the site can be improved.
    </p>

    <h3>Finding Problems</h3>
    <p>After choosing a site to redesign, I identified its flaws in terms of usability, learnability, and memorability.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Usability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It’s not <strong>intuitive</strong> that the hours and contact information for the restaurant are listed
                in
                an unmarked section at the bottom of the site; this is probably the first piece of information that
                users
                would like to know after visiting the site.
            </li>
            <li>
                The structure of the site does not lend itself to an <strong>efficient</strong> user experience; users
                must
                scroll past the entire menu before learning whether or not the restaurant is open.
            </li>
            <li>
                The menu bar does change in <strong>response</strong> to the user’s screen size, but the mobile screen
                size causes the
                “responsive” menu bar to be much harder to use since it’s messily formatted.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Learnability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Some headers are listed on the site’s menu bar (e.g., “Pizza”, “Salad”), but other headers at the same
                header level are not listed (“Create”); since site navigation is not consistent, it’s harder for users
                to learn.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Memorability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Use of the logo is limited, only appearing in the site’s favicon and the header (and it’s too small to
                actually see).
            </li>
            <li>
                There’s a lack of visual appeal due to the washed out looking images and the fact that the main landing
                image looks like a stock photo of nondescript floorboards.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
        In addition to analyzing the website on the three usability guidelines, I used WebAIM WAVE to detect possible
        accessibility problems.

        WebAIM WAVE points out that the contrast of the landing page text against the image is poor and makes the text
        difficult to read. I totally agree, since the text is white and the image contains some scattered white
        elements. Other than that, the site performs pretty well on WebAIM Wave's metrics, which I think is enabled by
        its simple design. There are some “skipped heading” issues, but I think those are not the end of the world and
        are more of a stylistic choice made by the site’s designers rather than an accessibility oversight.
    </p>

    <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
    <h3>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h3>
    <p>
        I created low-fidelity wireframes for the site using Balsamiq. I used the wireframes to test out different
        layouts and to get a sense of how the site would look on different screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, and
        mobile).
    </p>
    <h4>Desktop Wireframe</h4>

    <h4>Tablet Wireframe</h4>

    <h4>Mobile Wireframe</h4>

    <h3>Visual Design Style Guide</h3>
    <p>
        I also created a visual design style guide that displays the main colors, typography, and reusable
        components’ different states for the site. I used the style guide to make sure that the high-fidelity
        prototypes I created were consistent with the visual design of the site.

    <h3>High-Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
        Using Figma, I created a total of 3 high-fidelity prototypes for the site, one for each of the screen sizes
        (mobile, tablet, desktop).

        I annotated the elements within the prototype so that a developer would be able to take the designs and
        reproduce them without needing much additional explanation. In my redesign, I only needed to annotate the
        desktop version of the site since the styling is the same for the tablet and mobile versions.

    <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
    <p>Using the final high-fidelity prototypes, I created the redesigned page using HTML and CSS. You can find a link
        to the site <a href="../fellini">here</a>.</p>
