    <h1>Personas & Storyboarding</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this project, I construct two personas of users of my dishwasher with corresponding empathy maps based on
        data collected from multiple observation sessions in my apartment's kitchen in Providence. I also present a
        storyboard depicting the process by which a certain user persona might use my dishwasher.
    </p>
    <h2>Selected Interface: My Dishwasher</h2>
    <p>
        Dishwashers are used for automatically washing multiple dishes at a time. This dishwasher provides
        two racks on which the user can place their items. The top and bottom racks are similar, but the bottom rack
        notably includes a smaller subsection (on the right side) that is used for storing utensils and other
        similarly-sized items. Once the dishwasher is loaded, detergent must be loaded in the detergent slot on the
        inside of the dishwasher’s front door. Then, the door can be closed and a wash mode can be selected via the
        buttons on the top of the front door. The remaining duration of the dishwasher’s current run is displayed at
        the top center panel of the front door.

    <h2>User Observations</h2>
    <h3>Key Observations: A Summary</h3>
    <p>I observed consenting users in my kitchen as they used my dishwasher. To summarize my notes:</p>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        All five users ended up selecting the same washing mode (“Normal”, a 95-minute cycle). Some users used a single
        dish detergent pod, while others used a detergent pod as well as liquid dish detergent. In terms of dish
        placement within the washing machine, I observed a spectrum of behavior. Some users were very meticulous about
        how they placed their dishes, sometimes taking time to rearrange entire racks in the midst of loading the
        machine. On the other hand, some users seemed to load the dishwasher with a “first-fit” dish allocation method
        and did not rearrange dishes after placing them.
    </blockquote>
    <h3>User Interviews: A Summary</h3>
    <p>All five users were willing to answer a survey conducted after I observed their usage of the dishwasher. In this
        section, I've summarized their responses to each question.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How often do you typically run the dishwasher in a given week?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minimum: 1, median: 3, maximum: 7</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How many dishes do you usually place in the dishwasher before you run it?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All interviewees said they always ran the dishwasher with a full load.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you decide where to put certain items in the dishwasher? (e.g., utensils, plates,
            bowls, pans, etc.)
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One interviewee said that they do it “based on vibes.” I further clarified that they follow the
                constraints
                of
                the racks (more vertical space on bottom rack) as they load.</li>
            <li>Some interviewees load the shorter items (cups, bowls) on the top rack, larger items (plates, pans,
                larger
                bowls) on the bottom rack, and utensils in their respective compartments.</li>
            <li>Some interviewees expressed that they just go for the first place that an item will fit, since it saves
                them the time of having to decide where to put items.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you ever decide to handwash certain items rather than loading them into the
            dishwasher?
            Why?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The majority of interviewees said yes, for the following reasons:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Convenience (it might be too much work to get it to fit in the dishwasher)</li>
                <li>Sometimes dishwasher doesn’t clean entirely, so followup work is necessary</li>
                <li>Some items must be hand washed, or else they’ll stain (e.g. plastic containers)</li>
                <li>Some items don’t fit</li>
                <li>Some items mess up the water’s flow, especially larger ones</li>
                <li>One interviewee said no; “If some items cannot be loaded into the dishwasher, I’ll run a second
                    load.”
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What washing settings have you used on the dishwasher?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All interviewees primarily use the “Normal” setting, which runs for 95 minutes.</li>
            <li>One interviewee said that they’ve used 65 minutes and 95 minutes; they vary their behavior based on how
                dirty the dishes are.</li>
        </ul>
        </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Personas</h3>
        <p>
            Using my user observations and interview responses, I developed two personas
            to describe the ways in which users of my dishwasher perceive the dishwasher in my apartment. I also
            developed empathy maps for each persona to visually represent the thought processes and behaviors of
            different types of users of my dishwasher.
        </p>
        <h3>Persona 1: Fussy Frank</h3>
        <p>
            Fussy Frank cares a lot about cleanliness, and the dishwasher is a pillar of their cleaning practices. Since
            rack space in the dishwasher is limited, and the organization of dishes in the dishwasher affects the
            quality of the wash, Frank spends a lot of time wrangling the rack to enable the most optimal dishwashing
            experience. They also consider multiple wash modes on the interface in order to ensure that the dishes are
            properly washed. The Fussy Frank persona represents the subset of users that are very focused on cleanliness
            and are willing to put the extra effort into getting the most out of the dishwasher.

                <ul>
                    <li>“After washing the dishes, I’ll wipe down the counters and clean the stove top.”</li>
                    <li>“If I place this dish on the bottom rack, it’ll block some items on the top rack.”</li>
                    <li>“I hope I can fit all of these dishes in one load, or else I’ll have to wash some dishes by
                        hand…”</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Grossed out when the dishes aren’t completely washed</li>
                    <li>Satisfied after getting all dishes to fit</li>
                    <li>Grateful that the dishwasher has compartments for each type of utensils</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="item">

                    <li>“I’ll take care of cleaning tonight!”</li>
                    <li>“I noticed we’re running out of detergent; I’ll buy more!”</li>
                    <li>“If that dish won’t fit, I’ll just wash it by hand.”</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Uses both a detergent pod and liquid detergent</li>
                    <li>Rearranges the racks depending on the distribution of items</li>
                    <li>Picks the most optimal wash mode based on the dirtiness of the dishes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Persona 2: Speedy Sanford</h3>
        <p>
            Speedy Sanford doesn’t put cleanliness first, so they’re not afraid to cut corners in the dishwashing
            process if it’ll help them get to what they want to do faster. They don't think too much about dish
            organization or orientation, and instead decide to put dishes wherever they’ll fit first. Their goal is to
            get the job done, not to do the best job. The Speedy Sanford persona represents the subset of users that
            does not prioritize cleanliness and see the dishwasher as just a means to an end.

        <h2>Storyboards</h2>
        <p>
            As a final step in the project, I created a storyboard for Fussy Frank's user journey when they use the
            dishwasher. This storyboard aims to capture the following aspects of Fussy Frank's interactions with the
            interface:
        <ul>
            <li>Fussy Frank's prioritization of cleanliness over speed</li>
            <li>Fussy Frank's thoughtfulness when loading dishes into the dishwasher</li>
            <li>The ways that the dishwasher's interface enables Fussy Frank to optimize the degree of dish cleanliness
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
